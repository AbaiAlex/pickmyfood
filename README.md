# PickMyFood

PickMyFood is a simple offline web application that helps you decide where to eat when you cannot make a decision. If you are hungry, tired of debating, or stuck in the classic “where should we go” situation, this app makes the choice for you.

## Idea
Everyone knows the situation: you want to eat something, but you do not know what or where. Sometimes you even plan to go out every week, but it always ends in a debate. PickMyFood solves this by randomly choosing for you.

## How it works
- Add restaurants you like or want to try
- Assign weights so not every place has the same chance
- Set food categories to filter or search faster
- Let the app randomly pick a restaurant for you

The decision is random. The consequences are yours.

## Features
- Fully offline HTML app
- No backend, no tracking, no accounts
- Weighted random selection
- Food category support
- JSON import and export for easy sharing
- Simple and fast setup

## Data handling
Currently the app supports:
- Importing restaurant lists from JSON
- Exporting your configured list to JSON

This makes it easy to share your favorite restaurants with others.

## Language
The application is currently optimized for Hungarian only.  
Multi-language support is planned for the future.

## Future plans
- Random food selection, not just restaurants
- Multi-language support
- UI and UX improvements

## Disclaimer
PickMyFood only makes decisions.  
It does not guarantee good food, open restaurants, or happiness.
